This task features a custom food ordering form built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for Yemi food Hub. It allows clients to place orders for vegetarian or non-vegetarian meals. Orders are processed through a custom Webhook, and instant confirmations are delivered via Webhook responses. You can check the form User Interface (UI) <a href="https://salaamrasak.github.io/Custom_Food_Ordering/">here</a>.
